# Overview
The financier will lend money to the borrower and the borrower will repay him by giving post dated cheques (cheques that are written with a future date indicated on it).<br/>
Lender will charge an interest of 2.5% per month on the outstanding balance. Traditionally it takes 3 working days for any bank to clear/bounce a cheque. <br/>
Lender charges interest upon the outstanding balance from the day he lended his money till the day the cheque is realised and money reflects in financier's account.<br/>
